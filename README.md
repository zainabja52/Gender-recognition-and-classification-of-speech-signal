# Gender-recognition-and-classification-of-speech-signal

This project involves developing a MATLAB application for gender recognition and classification from speech signals. It focuses on differentiating between male and female voices using time and frequency domain analyses.

# Dataset
You must gather at least 20 male and 20 female voice recordings, ensuring diversity in age and recording environments. All recordings should say the word "Zero" and must be sampled at 44100 Hz.

# Installation
Clone the repository or download the MATLAB scripts.
Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.

# Features
Record 2-second audio clips and save them as WAV files.
Visualize waveform and frequency spectrum of recordings.
Classify gender based on energy levels in audio files.
Implement graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

# Usage
Record audio samples and place them in the appropriate directory.
Run the main script to start the gender classification process.
Use the GUI for a more interactive experience.
